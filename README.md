vagrant-sci-linux-6
========================

Scientific Linux 6 VM with various developer dependencies:

* Ruby
* Puppet
* Python 2.6
* Virtualenv
* Java (JVM + compiler)
* Leiningen (Clojure)
* ZeroMQ (libs + dev package)
* Node.js
* Git
* Subversion
* MySQL
* Postgres (installed but not started)

These are the things I need for various projects; you may wish to edit
`Vagrantfile` and/or `manifests/scientificlinux-61.pp` to suit.

To use:

1. `git clone` or otherwise checkout this repository and `cd` into the resulting directory.
1. install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
1. install [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/).
1. `vagrant box add scientificlinux-61 http://vagrant.phys.uvic.ca/scientificlinux-61.box`
1. `vagrant up`  **NOTE:** This will take awhile the first time you run it.

To login:

1. `vagrant ssh`.
